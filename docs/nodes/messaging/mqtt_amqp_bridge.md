The mqtt_amqp_bridge node
=====================

The mqtt_amqp-bridge node provides a message-order preserving and fail-safe mqtt-to-amqp bridge.
It is designed for minimized overhead, high throughput and fault-tolerant message delivery.
Receives data from an mqtt-broker and writes each indiviual topic with an amqp-publisher via an internal on-disk queue.

This node starts 1 mqtt-subscriber and up to `max_publishers` number of amqp-publishers.

The node does only work standalone at the moment, meaning you cannot connect it to other nodes.

The mqtt_amqp_bridge is completely unaware of the message content.
For performance reasons the node does not parse incoming data or use data_items as every other node
in faxe does, instead internally it will work with the raw binaries received from the mqtt broker and pass them through to the amqp publishers.


Example
-------
```dfs  
def topic = 'my/topic/#'
|mqtt_amqp_bridge() 
.topics(topic)
%% amqp params
.amqp_host('10.11.12.13') 
.amqp_user('user')
.amqp_pass('pass')
.amqp_exchange('x_exchange')
.amqp_ssl()
.max_publishers(5) 
 
```
