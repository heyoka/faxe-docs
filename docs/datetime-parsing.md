# Timestamps and Datetime strings in Faxe

In Faxe we deal a lot with timestamps and datetime strings, in fact, every message that flows through all the nodes, 
has a timestamp with it.

Its inner representation of points in time is always an integer denoting the milliseconds that past since 1.1.1970.
There is currently no timezone handling in Faxe.

## Datetime string parsing

Faxe uses its own library to parse datetime strings (from the outside) into it's internal timestamp format.
This is done in different nodes such as the [mqtt_subscribe](nodes/messaging/mqtt_subscribe.md) and the 
[amqp_consume](nodes/messaging/amqp_consume.md) node. Furthermore, datetime parsing can
be done in lambda-expression with the [dt_parse](dfs_script_language/built-in_functions.md#time-functions) function.

When parsing datetime strings with subsecond values smaller than milliseconds (microseconds and nanoseconds), if present, 
will be rounded to millisecond values.


### Parsing examples

| datetime                        | matching format string |
|---------------------------------|------------------------|
 | 'Mon, 15 Jun 2009 20:45:30 GMT' | 'a, d b Y H:M:S Z'     |
 | '19.08.01  17:33:44,867000 '    | 'd.m.y  H:M:S,u '      |
 | '8/28/2033 8:03:45.576000 PM'   | 'n/d/Y l:M:S.u p'      |


### Conversion Specification

The format used to parse and format dates closely resembles the one used
in `strftime()`[1]. The most notable exception is that meaningful characters
are not prefixed with a percentage sign (%) in *datestring*.

Characters not matching a conversion specification will be copied to the
output verbatim when formatting and matched against input when parsing.
Meaningful characters can be escaped with a backslash (\\).
